Oat Bakery is a lovely, much-needed surprise here in SB. The bread is fresh with (what I believe are) fresh ingredients and made from competent hands. And it's delicious!\nThe tastings are generous and they clearly separate the gluten-free bread from the rest. They also slice the loaves for you which I really appreciate so I can freeze some if needed. Oat also makes yummy spreads which are reasonably priced at $5 and they last for about 3 days. I hear Tuesdays are the best day for fresh bread but it's also Farmer's Market day so beware traffic. I'll go back for sure.","date":"2018-06-05 01:28:25"}

Holy wow, the texture is incredible, the taste is out of this world, and then you bite into a nut and get that nice crunch and another burst of flavor. It's actually ridiculous. The sage garlic loaf is also good but be warned, the garlic is intense. I got some different loaves for appetizers for a party and everyone agreed it was amazing. It's perfect for a cheese board or to eat as a side with a meal.

I have an allergy to refined sugar that makes it impossible to buy bread in a store.  Your breads are marvelous.  Super moist and amazing.\n\nI also was in awe of the Super Seed Cookie the first time I tried it. Again, can't buy cookies because of the allergy so what a special treat.  However, I will have to say that the cookies have been hit and miss.  Sometimes they simply don't taste good at all!  Way off to the point of throwing it out but when you pay $4.00 for a cookie plus a tip you choke it down anyway.  I talked to a friend about this and she suggested that dates go bad and that was probably why the cookies were sometime not so good.  Also it seems the consistency of recipe for this one seems to be off.  The 1st time I had it the sweetness was amazing and the cinnamon notes were just awesome subsequent purchases were just so, so in this regard.\n\nHoping that you can do something to move your customer line a little faster.  Arriving at 9:08 and having to stand in line for 30 minutes for 1 item is a bit of a bummer.  This is even being number 8 in line.  I would imagine that you are loosing a great deal of business because people just don't want to stand there that long.  Why you started serving coffee I will never understand! This addition only exacerbates the long SLOW line. I wish I had a suggestion how to streamline your process at checkout.  Maybe your brilliant bakers and staff can come up with a solution.  Seems like you might need a second window or a larger facility. Not a bad problem to have.  :-)\n\nMaybe ask the customer if they are having coffee 1st thing when they walk up.  Call out to someone else to make the coffee while the nice young woman at the front continues with the bread order. \n\nThanks again!","date":"2021-03-13 18:22:17"}

Every single one of their breads has been delicious so far and I can't wait to try more! \n\nThey even have amazing spreads to go with their breads. I've had the pesto and the truffle cream cheese. Both of these spreads have been incredible! Everytime I come here I tend to eat the bread right away and never save it since it's so good. I'm excited to try the new breads and spreads soon!\n\nOat Bakery is the such an amazing local bakery in town that you don't want to miss! Check them out if your looking for a perfect bread for everyone. They have so many choices which make it the perfect place to please everyone's bread cravings.\n\nI highly recommend giving this bakery a try! I'll be back soon Oat Bakery! :)","date":"2018-12-28 01:45:27"}

Well one day I was in a juice shop in town and ordered Avo toast which came on a bread that came from this bakery and ever since I'm a converted bakeriette if such a thing exists.\n\nIn the old days you could walk in this place almost empty and smell all of the wonderful breads stacked up next to each other to throw your nostril at. But now that's all changed, you know  like the toilet paper and soap thing in 2020 -- so even if I try my best to show up at 9 am I'm looking at lines of people eating to get some of their goodies. Like a 20-30 minute wait on a Saturday morning. \n\nSo all this writing talk but what the deal with why this bread is so good.  First off it's made freshly every day and they are not afraid to use a lot of of whole grains and gluten free flours so that anyone can find something interesting.  Most are vegan too except for a few that have cheese. \n\nMy favorites here are the superseed. That bread lasts for weeks as it's so dense. Great triple  toasted  with nut butter on top GF. They are gluten free they also make a superseed cookie that is pretty phenomenal too.  I also like their sage garlic in either gluten free or regular, the shiitake shallot.  I'm more on the savory spectrum but if you like more sweeter option they have those too. Heck they even have a charcoal bread for those needing a bit of a detox;)\n\nPrices are crazy high here I see people throwing out $100 bills without a hitch.  I suck it up and throw out the CC and then they will ask you what kind of tip if any you would like to give to the bakers of course not the servers.  Bravo to the bakers.  \n\nDon't mess around folks. Get here early, be patient,  bring the wallet and when you are at home biting into your sliced triple toasted slice of bread you will realize that the smile it gave you was worth every dollar.

Over the last 6 months I've become totally in love with visiting Oat Bakery. The phenomenal staff is incredibly kind and authentically welcoming. You can sense their genuine love for what they create and their appreciation for their customers. Everything here is done artfully. Each item is carefully created. The entire menu boasts flavor, texture, aroma and is also incredibly aesthetically pleasing. I stopped eating store bought bread\/crackers\/pasta 10+ years ago. I always bloated and felt super inflamed, weighed down and even grumpy so I cut out the gluten and never looked back. Until a friend insisted we visit here last November. Despite a lot of reluctance, I caved less than a hour after she bought her goods. The smell was driving me crazy in the best way! Expecting the bloat to hit like a brick, I still kept eating. Almost the entire focaccia loaf! I couldn't stop even despite knowing how I was going to feel. Well guess what! It never happened. Not after eating. Not that night. Not when I woke the next morning. I was shocked! But certainly not mad. Oat is a must at least once a week but ideally 2! Try everything. It's all so good, I promise! You can taste and feel the love in each bite. In our world, There's thrift store clothes and there's Chanel. There's Hyundai's and there's Ferraris. There's store bought bread and there's Oat. There is simply no comparison. If you appreciate craft, luxury, innovation and heart felt energy put into your foods, this is your place. My mom recently went to grab a loaf of bread from Lazy Acres and I bout had a heart attack in the store and insisted we drove downtown if she wanted bread. She said \"there's literally a wall of bread right in front of us.\"  I said \"this is not bread. It just looks like it. You want bread? We're going downtown!\" She was a bit confused by my passion. Then we arrived. All doubts were laid to rest upon just seeing their beautiful display box. I'm telling you, Oat is a a true GEM!! The 6 Star Luxury Resort of Baked Goods. I have so much gratitude for all the women and the 1 gentleman working here. Each visit is as nourishing for the spirit as it is for the gut so treat yo self! I LOVE YOU OAT!!

Plus it freezes perfectly, it's like a unicorn bread \n\nThe ladies who work there couldn't possibly be any sweeter and have the very best customer service ever, they found the very best people \n\nI've also tried their homemade granola and AMAZING spreads....I think everything they make turns to gold, they're magic makers \n\nBest place ever, you'll be beyond happy that you discovered it","date":"2020-05-26 22:12:06"}

I tried the Shitake shallot one based on couple of the bakers' recommendations. I was disappointed as the crumb was doughy and felt as though the bread was not fully baked.  \nMight of been a one-off thing given all the 5 star reviews.","date":"2021-04-01 05:00:11"}

If I could, I'd give more than 5 stars. I work in the specialty food\/drink world and am always on the lookout for local artisanal spots when I travel: Oat bakery is exactly it! My wife and I got the Hygge bun and the pecorino thyme and couldn't be more thrilled. Our items were definitely fresh, flavorful and well presented. Whether you're a local or just stopping through town, Oat Bakery is a must try! Cheers!","date":"2020-09-12 20:27:02"}

This husband and wife owned Scandinavian bakery has a charming storefront with gorgeous blue tiles and a \"we loaf you\" pun (more bread puns on their website too!). I've noticed that other restaurants like Satellite use Oat Bakery's organic, handmade bread, so you know their bread has to be good!\n\nI loved the hygge (pronounced \"hue-gah\") bun! Warm and crunchy on the outside, this bun was heavenly with jammy chunks of dates and comforting flavors of cinnamon and cardamom. The thick superseed cookie with dark chocolate wasn't what I expected. It didn't taste like a typical cookie in both flavor and texture but rather a healthy energy bar, but I still enjoyed it as a mid-afternoon snack. The vegan and gluten free truffle cashew cream cheese had a thinner texture similar to hummus; I wish it was thicker like cream cheese. However, the spread was still delicious with a strong truffle flavor and pairs well with the shiitake shallot bun, which was soft and pretty moist inside. Even though it's called a bun, its size is larger and more like a small loaf. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of their buns and breads!","date":"2021-08-16 22:43:02"}

The line is always long but so worth it. My absolute favorites and go-tos are Date Almond Bun, Hygge Bun (ya try to not mess up that pronunciation) , and the super-seed cookie. I'm talking MOUTH WATERING, what dreams are made of good. \n\nSo why 4 stars? On the numerous occasions I have been here - I won't even say how many times to spare me that embarrassment- They are NOT consistent. You'll either get a bun with TONS of almonds, dates or whatever they promise, a BIG cookie , OR you'll be madly disappointed the next week when you pay the same amount for a subpar version of what you waited to eat all week for breakfast. My suggestion is this- look at what is good. If it looks pathetic that day, chances are it tastes as such too. \n\nI'll be of course returning, hoping for that fully loaded bun, cookie, or bread. However, I wouldn't be surprised if I have to go back and ask for my soggy, undercooked bread to be replaced.","date":"2021-02-27 20:50:29"}

Glad I got to try this place over July 4th when visiting SB.\n\nSo many unique breads to choose from. I got the shiitake mushroom, almond date, pumpkin seed, whole wheat focaccia, and charcoal sesame. Had to eat this throughout a week and amongst 6 people. The loaves are pretty massive haha\n\nAbsolutely loved the shiitake and the whole wheat focaccia and second fave would be the charcoal sesame. \nOthers were good but I prefer the more savory type of breads and they did an excellent job with flavor and each was true to description. \n\nHope I can stop by on my next trip and try some more out  in addition to my faves :)","date":"2020-07-13 05:11:22"}

With incredible, fresh-baked loaves and buns, Oat Bakery is making eating bread \"cool\" again. My favorite things to order are the Brie & Cherry Loaf, Spinach & Feta Loaf, Savory Hygge Bun (think Cheesy Monkey Bread with Herbs), Sweet Hygge (think Cinnamon Roll but better, made with dates) and their House Made Granola. I also love their Cashew Truffle Spread (think truffle cream cheese without the cheese.) \n\nThe Gluten Free bread could be employed by the CIA and go under cover as traditional bread without ever breaking cover. It's that good! On one of my visits to the Ty Lounge at the Four Seasons Biltmore Resort, a group of tourists with Celiac Disease ordered their charcuterie board with a side of Gluten Free crostini. After taking their first bite, they flagged the waiter down and proceeded to admonish him for bringing them gluten bread. They were sure it contained gluten because it tasted so good. Nope, it was Oat Bakery's delicious, double-agent, Gluten Free bread. I couldn't resist chiming in and doting about SB's gem of a local bakery and vouching that their crostini was in fact gluten free. They finished their board and bread with delight (and NO anaphylactic shock)!\n\nMany local restaurants and eateries procure their bread from Oat Bakery. Love the Fancy Avocado Toast at Caje? Their Charcoal Sourdough Bread is from Oat Bakery. Crazy about the Raw Cashew Toast at Juice Ranch? - Their bread is from Oat Bakery. Does Healthy Warrior's SuperFood Breakfast Toast make you Happy? - It's also from Oat Bakery! The list goes on and on. Oat Bakery is a hit not to be missed! \n\nThe shop itself is quaint; tucked discreetly between a few other businesses off State Street on Guiterez Street. Blink and you could miss it. This is not a sit down and eat establishment, although their are usually a couple of bar stools inside along bay windows looking out onto Downtown Santa Barbara. Order at the counter and take your goodies to go. It's the perfect stop before a picnic, wine tasting or stroll to the beach. Not to mention before a dinner party. Show up with a few loaves from Oat Bakery at your next gathering and you'll be the Belle of the Ball!","date":"2020-02-09 18:28:46"}
