I ordered at the counter inside and waited outside at the patio table for about 10 minutes for my order. We ordered 6 empanadas for the 2 of us, which was the perfect amount. Since my fiancee is vegetarian, we tried all four vegetarian options: caprese, fugazzeta,, quinoa, and humita. They come in slightly different shapes so you can identify which is which after you open the box at home. The flavors were absolutely perfect - my favorite was the fugazzeta (blue cheese and sauteed onions in an empanada? yes please!!). Highly recommend!","date":"2017-09-20 16:04:30"}

Always yes.\n\nFound this spot super close to our airbnb during a weekend in Santa Barbara, so my friend and I walked here. We got half a dozen, and were happily surprised by both the veggie and meat options. \n\nI'm from the Bay Area...and our empanada spot in the city is El Porte√±o's. Comparing Buena Onda's to that...I'd say the portion sizes are much smaller, but filling choices are way more diverse. They have the same ones like fugazetta and suiza...but different ones that have caprese filling or a quinoa-based inside! It's such a great little snack if you want to have a lighter meal, or have something to snack on with your drinks.\n\nWe bought them hot in a box to go, but they also partner with SB menus if you want to order online or need delivery. This place is located in a factory-like setup...with no frills ordering at the cashier, and a waiting area outside on their front \"porch\" with private parking. There is also a lot of street parking too, if the private lot gets full. We saw customers who clearly ordered ahead online or by phone, and came to pick up their warm goodies.

Whenever I come up from Ventura on a day trip I try to make sure I stay past 4 p.m. even if it means I get stuck in traffic, just so I can stop by here. It looks like they might have started opening for limited lunch hours!!!\n\nThe empanadas have a wonderful filling to dough ratio. Both the filling and the dough are wonderfully flavorful. Their chimichurri sauce is on point. \n\nDeciding what to order? \n\nThe Carne is a delicious and flavorful ground beef empanada which is most closest to a traditional empanada. Hands down my favorite of the meat options. Doesn't need the chimichurri, but if it's provided, why not? \n\nPollo is shredded chicken. It's not as flavorful as the Carne is. Better for people who like really mild flavors. One of the few empanadas that need the chimichurri to be perfect. \n\nI love my meat, but the Quinoa empanada is one of the few things that I would find to be on par with any meat dish. This is such a wonderful balance with the quinoa, feta, garlic, peppers and other delicious veggies. It would really be a shame if you missed out on this one. It's a favorite on par with the Carne. \n\nProsciutto is nice. You can identify the slices of meat swimming in the cheese. It's a very tempting option as I have never run across a prosciutto empanada before. While it's worth a try, if I'm limited to three choices this is an easy skip. It's more cheese heavy than prosciutto and the grease that results is a contrast from their normally flavorful and clean tasting flavors.\n\nSuiza is the veggie and cheese heavy option. If given a choice I like the tart balance of the feta in the quinoa over this one. However, if you are a huge garlic and cheese lover, this may very easily be your favorite. Super wonderful and flavorful. \n\nHongo\/fugazette- I love mushroom. And I love what Buena Onda does with mushrooms. They are lovingly saut√©ed, lovingly seasoned, and lovingly stuffed and baked. When they were out of the fugazette (mushrooms, onions and bleu cheese) I was in a period of serious mourning. I'm glad they brought back a mushroom in the form of the Hongo (now with mozzarella). \n\nVegan- unless you are a vegan, I would keep to the rest of the empanadas. Do not get me wrong...This will kick the butt of any street vendors empanada, or any fancy sit down restaurant. That being said, there are so many better and taster options here. \n\nI love this place. At $3.50 an empanada it is very reasonable. They do not skimp on the filling. The ingredients that they use are clearly a cut above once you take the first bite. The chimichurri is a perfect match. The people are lovely and if you happen to want to wait at Telegraph Brewing, they will walk your order over. This is hands down my favorite empanadas and my favorite place to come to in Santa Barbara. \n\nPro tip: call your order in and it will be waiting for you. \n\nWhat are you waiting for? Stop on by! Go in for lunch, bring some to a work potluck and be called a culinary hero! Just help this place take over the world :) they are just that good!","date":"2018-09-30 00:31:27"}

Wow, I rarely have met an empanada I don't like, but these are the best I can recall having...at least from recent memory.\n\nThe group I went with ordered a wide variety, but the two that stood out most to me was the carne and quinoa empanada. So fresh, with just the right crisp to the crust. They were also quite generously stuffed which is always appreciated when it comes to empanada appreciation. \n\nEven though the place was steadily busy, the line moved quite quickly. It's safe to say I will be returning soon!","date":"2017-10-15 05:52:37"}

It's inside of an open gated parking lot just adjacent to the mini mart. Along with being hard to find, Buena Onda is closed Sun-Tuesday and then opens at 4 pm on the other days. Plan accordingly.\nTwo good looking Argentinos (people from Argentina tend to be good looking for some reason) took my order of a dozen (3 Caprese, 3 Pollo, 3 Carne (beef) and 3 Suiza).\nI did not realize coming in that the Empies are made to order and would arrive piping hot. So  all i had to do was open the box and run from the red eyed, crazed Twin Peaks horde hungry for blood but settling for Empanadas i'm thinking. I cut off the end of all varieties so that i could sample.\nFirst of all the dough. The dough was very special: firm yet velvety, buttery: melting on the tongue as it finally releases its fillings which are another story of goodness. An Empanada dough has to be hearty enough to hold the fillings in without melting away to nothing  yet tender enough to caress your teeth not break them. I've had bad Empanada dough so i know of what i speak.\nCaprese: tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, olive oil. simple, amazingly good stuff. I love caprese Salads, Pasta and i love this product.\nPollo: pulled chicken, bell peppers, onions and some spice. Not my favorite but the Twin Peaks horde liked this very much.\nCarne Picata: ground beef, olives, hard boiled egg. Reminds me of a stuffed beef item called Matambre i had in Buenas Aires years ago. Delicious.\nSuiza: Brie (yes, melted scrumptious Brie), Swiss Chard and Sage. My favorite. All melty brie and nutty, slightly spicy Swiss chard . Yum.\nWe dipped these in the Argentinian version of Salsa, Chimichurri which is chock full of herbs, garlic and olive oil. I  should have ordered extra but instead we used a bowl of Roasted Pasilla chili salsa i made earlier in the day that worked very well.\nThough I don't know for sure i'm assuming that the Buena Onda use their terrific dough to encase all manner of luscious fillings not on the menu that day like maybe spinach and feta? Or mushrooms and swiss?\nIn any event, the Twin Peakers only made it through 10 episodes and the mantras of the night were, not suprisingly : \"I am Dead yet I Live\" and \"Fire Walk with Me.\"","date":"2017-05-22 23:43:19"}

The cashier immediately said no and flipped the sign. I would've hoped they respected the fact that I was already in line for 15 minutes and obviously cannot rush the customers in front of me or speed up the line. I would've been fine if they had at least told me in a respectful manner no the lunch special ended, sorry, but because they were rude I decided something had to be said.

Wow! I was pleasantly surprised at the whole experience. Buena Onda has a very welcoming Argentina flair to the store and front patio. Issa Vibe! We ordered 3 Guacho special (short rib & potatoes), 1 Pollo(fee range chicken), 1 Humita (corn & onions), 1 Hongos (mushrooms & mozzarella), 1 Carne (grass feed beef) and Chimichurri Papas. We took our order to go, and I greatly appreciate how they provided small plates, napkins, and wooden forks and knifes. We split the food between three people and we had leftovers to take home. I honestly did not have a favorite because they were all so good! The Humita was just corn and onion but it was sweet and delicious. The Gaucho reminded me of a pot roast, Hongos was cheesy goodness! I would order them again. It was the prefect food to take on a picnic. Can't wait to go back and try some more. Adding this spot to my Santa B√°rbara Favorite Eats!!","date":"2020-01-05 23:21:55"}

The empanadas were the best I've ever had. The crust is amazingly flaky and tender and the filling was generous and perfectly seasoned. For the mushroom filling, it wasn't your typical generic gray pasty filling. You can see mushrooms and whole ingredients used so it tasted homemade and rustic. The soup was delicious as well and I highly recommend getting it to accompany the empanadas. I'd say get 2-3 for dinner. If I was in the area I'd be here every week. There's plenty of seating outside with heaters at night. The staff were very friendly and fast. I can't wait to go back to SB to pick up some more empanadas.","date":"2019-12-20 20:14:26"}

First restaurant I ever been to in Santa Barbara and I knew I had to pick a good one. They have a perfect 5 star on Yelp and I wanted to see why. I got the 3 empanada + side combo $15. The empanadas were baked perfectly and STUFFED with goodness. They had a good crisp and weren't soggy. \n\n* Guacho empanada: beef brisket, potatoes, red onion, tomatoes. I started with this one first. I was super surprised with the amount of beef they were able to fit in it. It was really good, so I was surprised when the next two were even better. This special empanada is inspired by the UCSB mascot. \n\n* Serrano empanada: prosciutto ham, mozzarella, garlic, wild arugula. looked a little chubbier than the rest. This one was especially cheesy, which I appreciated. Definitely recommend for cheese lovers.\n\n* Hongos empanada: crimini mushrooms, spinach, peppers, red onions, mozzarella. Probably my favorite one. Lots of mushrooms and it was also a cheesy wonderland. \n\n* Chimi papas: this was side of potatoes that came with the meal. It was a little saltier for my preference but great nonetheless. The dressing went nice with the potatoes. \n\n* Az was my waitress, she was super informative and lit up the room with her awesome energy. I ordered the empanadas based on her recommendations and was not disappointed. Not only does this restaurant have great food, it also has wonderful employees. \n\nI see why this place is 5 stars on Yelp. Best empanadas I've ever had!","date":"2021-06-11 21:32:31"}

It needed more seasoning or flavor, and the shredded chicken inside was dry.\n\nOverall, it was great getting to pick and choose what empanadas we wanted!

My friend, her husband & I ordered 12 empanadas to share between us- we ordered the Pollo, Caprese, Batata and their special that day the Gaucho. Each empanada was full of flavor and crunch! I especially enjoyed the Batata (it's vegan!) it was sweet and with the chimichurri dipping side it was a mouthful of flavor that made me want more. \nWith the consciousness of us being in a pandemic they offer orders to go and family meals that are cold\/frozen so you can enjoy whenever you eat dinner.

The humitas were my fave, and the bil said he liked his meat pies.

I also ordered the Bondi, which was a special. That was incredibly delicious! The beer braised pork was so good, and the meat was tender and delicious. If they have that on the menu, it's a must get. The prosciutto was really good too. It was very cheesy, so when you eat it and then realize there's prosciutto is like a nice surprise.

Upon first bite, I'm momentarily taken away from my surroundings and transported to an Argentinian dining room. The flavors, texture, and aroma ooze with culture. My favorite empanada is the Carne. I love dipping it in their Chimichurri and aioli sauces. \n\nI highly recommend ordering a dozen and trying a variety of empanadas. They reheat well on the off chance you cannot finish a dozen in one meal. It is not that they are small, it's that they're so delicious you'll want to keep eating them even after you're full. \n\nThe outdoor patio is very inviting for being wedged in the middle of a busy urban street. It's a lovely place to dine alone or gather with friends. You can also enjoy live music a few nights a week under the twinkle of hanging outdoor lights. \n\nIf you don't feel like dining out, call ahead and place an order to go, or have them delivered right to your doorstep via Grubhub. \n\nFor those who have a sweet tooth like yours truly, the fresh baked cookies they sell are a must try!

His team even came onsite once to check the venue\/spacing and provided to-go boxes for our guests to take leftovers.\n\nHere's what I ordered: \nCarne - my favorite empanada! All are crispy, soft, and filled with delicious filling but the carne was just extra juicy and tasty. \nPollo - the seasoning on the chicken was spot on\nCaprese - imagine a melty cheesy pizza roll but 10x more cheese \nVegan - we picked the quinoa option and it was rly filling\nGF - didn't try this one \nChips & guac - lots & lots of guac! \nGrilled veggies \nSalad with grilled chicken on the side - we had 3 guests on a low carb diet so Buena Onda came up with this great option\nAlfajores - generous dulce de leche filling sandwiched between two cookies (kind of like short bread) I wish they had powdered sugar coated on the outside but that is just me being alfajores-obsessed. \nPeanut butter cookies (GF) - SO DELICIOUS! It was filled with chocolate chips, moist, and had the perfect amount of peanut better. The cookie still tasted good 3 days after too. \n\nYerba mate - they have their own special recipe! I recommend it. \n\nMy guests were obsessed and went back for thirds! Buena Onda needs to expand so I can have them cater all my events (to the Bay Area especially)!!","date":"2019-06-10 06:09:58"}

Savage!\n\nTried 3 flavors and rated in order of what to get. \n-Chille Verde - special of the day and the favorite of the three. The meat was tender and the flavors were rich.\n-Carne - ground beef with that taco seasoning type of flavor that was really yummy. \n-Suiza - creamy. If you like that rich, white sauce.

Unfortunately, I haven't had as many chances to go there after they moved to Santa Barbara.  The empanadas are delicious, and some of my favorites are sweet and creamy humita, garlicky ham and arugula, and tender savory chicken.    They also have many none meat and none dairy varieties to satisfy everyone.  Empanadas are big and filling, 2-3 are plenty per person for a meal.  They now sell family meals and frozen empanadas so you can bake them at home whenever you like.  I hope they make it thru this pandemic and come out better than ever.","date":"2020-04-12 05:26:18"}

We loved them all. My favorite was the Carne. The Carne is savory and rich, with a bit of heat that warms the throat. The Caprese was like a little pizza, the cheese was creamy and the basil and tomato nice and herbaceous and slightly spicy. The Serrano was a ham and cheese delight.\n\nIt doesn't often happen that we take out more food following a full dinner. We certainly were full when we were ready to settle our account. We couldn't eat another bit. But we wanted more. Thank goodness Buena Onda understands their customers. We ordered an additional dozen empanadas to take home for the following day. Buena Onda knows its customers want take-out. You can order take-out fully prepared, half-baked, or frozen, as fits your needs. Our breakfast the following morning?

You know...empanadas... a fried turnover pastry with sweet or savory filling. Well I got wind that they had a few vegan options, which gave me all the more reason to swing by. I arrived during the evening and when you walk in you can almost taste them in the air. There were two people ahead of me and a few behind me. I had already placed an order over the phone so once it was my turn I simply said the magic words and paid my bill. \n\nThe options were vegana quinoa (peppers, spinach, quinoa, and vegan cream cheese) and Hakuna Batata (shallot, sweet potato yam, and spinach)--I ordered both. They also have meat empanadas and they are all oven baked to order. Both were quite delicious but of the two the Hakuna Batata stole the show--it means no worries, am I right or am I right? My order came with a herb\/grassy olive oil dressing for the empanadas which was nice and I was quite full once I finished my meal. They have outdoor seating and twinkle lights for an elegant look. \n\nWhat I love about them is that they are authentic and organic. Their dough and fillings are housemade. You can purchase in bulk or family meals for a better deal. They also have frozen empanadas that you can take home and cook at your leisure. They even serve soups, salads, and desserts. After a few years the secret is out fresh and bake to order empanadas right here in sunny Santa Barbara.

The ordering process was smooth via their foodbooking.com ordering website. We called on the phone to ask about daily specials (Pro tip: always call and ask, as these often rotate!) I also asked about dietary needs, and the person we spoke with was helpful and friendly. As a vegan who is allergic to cashews, I wanted to make sure the restaurant's vegan cheese wasn't cashew-based. Our friendly employee was kind enough to get the package and read out the ingredients (it's soy+coconut-based, so I was in luck.)\n\nThat kind of customer service already had me thinking 5* and then we tasted the food. I ordered one each of the Vegana (organic red quinoa, peppers, onions, vegan cheese and spinach, wrapped in vegan dough made with Earth Balance) and the Hakuna Batata (sweet potatoes, spinach and shallots in vegan dough), $3.5 each. My friend had the Suiza (filled with Swiss chard, leeks, brie, and sage, and the Quinoa (basically the Vegana but with goat cheese instead of vegan cheese), also $3.5 each. In addition she ordered a sweet empanada made with quince. One little hiccup was that the sweet empanada said it came filled with emmental but instead featured goat cheese--no biggie there though, as she enjoyed it anyway. The side of chimichurri was totally delicious, if far more oily than either of us would have made it. \n\nIf you're looking for something that tastes traditionally Argentine, this isn't it, at least not based on what we ordered. We realized that as a vegetarian and a vegan, we likely wouldn't get classic flavors, since this empanader√≠a is trying to innovate rather than replicate (say, using veggie pork, onions, and potato.) We thoroughly enjoyed our empanadas and their novel flavor combinations, and would definitely order from Buena Onda again!","date":"2021-03-04 05:27:49"}

After leaving Pacific Grove at 10.30am on Thursday morning we had driven over 300 miles to Santa Barbara. It was after 6pm and we had just departed the Tesla Supercharger in Goleta...and we were starving. My wife found this empanada place online while our Tesla was charging and it read well. We decided to grab take-out and then check in at our Casita at The Eagle Inn. I phoned ahead to place an order with Adam for 2 x Empanadas - Pollo ( Mary's chicken, onions & bell peppers ) & Serrano ( Prosciutto ham, mozzarella, garlic  & wild arugula ) for my wife and 1 x 3 Empanadas Combo - Carne (  Sunfed ranch grass-fed ground beef, onions, bell peppers, green olives & free-range hard boiled egg ) - Caprese ( Organic roma tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, basil, & extra virgin olive oil ) - Hongas ( Crimini mushrooms, organic spinach, caramelized red onions & mozzarella ) + Side of Choice - Chimi Papas ( Chimichurri oven roasted potatoes topped with housemate aioli ) for me. We pulled into their tight parking lot just before 6.30pm and I walked inside ( wearing my facial mask ) to collect our take-out order. A young dude ( wearing a facial mask ) behind the counter looked after me and checked our phone order before going to retrieve it. All packed up in a couple of cardboard boxes...I paid and we headed to our hotel. Finally in our hotel suite about 7pm we settled down to watch the baseball world series and enjoy our dinner. Trust me these delicious gourmet empanadas are the real deal...top quality ingredients and fresh as a daisy. We loved 'em !","date":"2020-11-04 01:33:41"}

This is my first time ever trying empanadas and I loved it!\n\nWe arrived Saturday a little before 2PM I believe and it was popping! Thi=e mosaic locale location is located on State across from the Museum of Art. We had a bit of trouble locating it, but I wouldn't say this location is an actual restaurant. They share the interior with a donut shop along with a beer shop. There's no parking lot, so park in one of the lots downtown. \n\nMy group of four ordered a dozen of empanadas for $39. We ordered a mix of meats (carne, pollo, prosciutto) and veggie empanadas. We had a vegan in our group and there were TONS of veggie options, so no worries here! The empanadas were pre-made so the workers obviously heated them up before serving us.\n\nIt's a super informal place, everything is mostly self serve, self seat. They have a great outdoor area that is super cute with pillows and heaters. Empanadas are served on paper plates with wooden utensils. We finished our empanadas before we realized they forgot to give us two of them! But luckily, it was sitting on top the toaster and the lady forgot to give them to us.\n\nThe empanadas were GREAT! The sauce that came with them was cooling and the perfect light mixture to the filling empanadas. My personal favorite was actually the chicken, then the prosciutto, then carne. The prosciutto empanada tasted just similar to a pizza! The dough was fluffy and chewy. It was nothing like I've ever had before. Delicious and totally worth the try! Super affordable too. \n\nNote -- the Yelp check in offer does not work at this location since it's a smaller shop :(","date":"2021-06-02 07:42:43"}

I got a sampler and my favorite was the beef.  Bummed I didn't realize they had dessert empanada until I left so no I'll have to go back for sure!","date":"2019-11-30 01:50:09"}

They are very close to the venue. Called in my order and was ready in 10-15 mins. They hold up very well as I brought a cooler with me and they stayed in the car for a few hours with no problemo!!!!! We ate a couple when we got home after heating them in the toaster oven (you can also reheat them in an air fryer). Perfecto!!!! And I know from experience that empanadas freeze very well! \n\nThe staff was very nice and the place, although just doing a pick up, looked very cute with an  outside patio.

Fresh , perfectly prepared, and creatively filled these little half pies are perfect for a party or just a light meal served with soup.
